# Components

The following are the key components needed to build the `Agapay` network:

## Digital Credentials

The `Verifiable Credentials` model places the holder (Nonprofit Organization) at the center of the identity system
and giving them control over their identity and data.

The trust model is more "decentralized" and allows for a more open and competitive marketplace of identity solutions.

Service Providers can issue `Verifiable Credentials` to `Entities`, `Organizations` and `Addresses`.

`Verifiable Credentials` make the information in the database instantly verifiable and tamper-resistent.

## Distributed Database

At the crux of an `open` network is the database of `Organizations` and their `Addresses`.

We believe this database should be completely public and free.

Organizations should retain self-sovereignty over the data in the database.

The database itself enforces consistency and validity through a distributed consensus model.

There exists a contract between the network Service Providers and the database that ensures
data records are valid Addresses.

## Open Settlement Layer

The actual settlement layer is decoupled from the database of `Addresses`.

`Addresses` are simply pointers to real-world identifiers in a payment network's settlement layer.

This allows the `Agapay` network to service a variety of different settlement layers including
over the Federal Reserve's RTP network, ACH, and card networks as well as utilizing
decentralized, blockchain-based networks like on-chain wallets, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies in the future.
