# Motivation

The motivation for this project is to create a truly open database and network for payments to nonprofits.
As part of this, we need to differentiate it from existing payment networks and databases, e.g. PayPal Grant Payments.

The following are the key differentiators:

- **Open Network** - Any `Organization` can join and receive payments.
- **Open Database** - The database is public and free.
- **Self Sovereignty** - `Organizations` own their own `Addresses` and can move freely between network service providers or even be their own network service provider.
- **Network Agnostic** - `Addresses` can be used with any `open-network` payment network which encourages competition and drives down network costs for the benefit of participants.
- **Competition** - Network `Service Providers` can compete on price and features which will drive down costs and increase innovation which has positive reinforcement feedback for the network itself.
